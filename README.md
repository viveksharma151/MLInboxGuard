# MLInboxGuard
A machine learning-based web application that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled SMS messages and utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization combined with a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

 
üîç Overview
This project is a machine learning-based SMS classification system built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It aims to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

During development, multiple classification algorithms were tested and compared, including:

‚óâ Multinomial Naive Bayes (Final Model) ‚Äì Achieved highest accuracy and speed for text classification
‚óâ Logistic Regression ‚Äì Performed well but slightly lower recall on spam messages
‚óâ Support Vector Machine (SVM) ‚Äì High precision, but computationally heavier
‚óâ Random Forest ‚Äì Good accuracy but slower and prone to overfitting on small text data

The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with Multinomial Naive Bayes delivering the best balance of performance and simplicity for text classification. The selected model uses TF-IDF vectorization and is deployed via Streamlit for real-time prediction.
