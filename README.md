# MLInboxGuard
A machine learning-based web application that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled SMS messages and utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization combined with a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

 
üîç Overview

This project is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It processes raw SMS text messages, transforms them using **TF-IDF vectorization**, and classifies them using a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model.

üöÄ Features

- Clean and simple UI built with Streamlit
- Real-time SMS classification
- Text preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal
- TF-IDF vectorization of text
- Model training and evaluation in Jupyter Notebook
- Trained model and vectorizer saved with `pickle`
